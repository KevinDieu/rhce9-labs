## Next comes the main part: which users can run what software on 
## which machines (the sudoers file can be shared between multiple
## systems).
## Syntax:
##
## 	user	MACHINE=COMMANDS
##
## The COMMANDS section may have other options added to it.
##
## Allow root to run any commands anywhere 
{% for user in users %}
{{user.name}}	ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
{% endfor %}
